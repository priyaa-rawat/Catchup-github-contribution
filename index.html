        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
            GitHub is a website for developers and programmers to collaboratively work on code. The primary benefit of GitHub is its version control system, which allows for seamless collaboration without compromising the integrity of the original project. The projects on GitHub are examples of open-source software.Git encourages granular recording of changes, programmers, be they absolute beginners or experts, can trace the steps of some of the greatest developers in the world and find out how they solved<i class="fa fa-check" style="font-size:30px;color:darkgreen"></i> thorny  problems.

        <h2>History:</h2>
        <p>Development of GitHub   &nbsp<i class="fa fa-github" style="font-size:30px;color:black"></i>&nbsp platform began on October 1,2007. The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett after it had been made available for a few months prior as a beta release. Since then it has brought millions of developers together to discover, share, and build better software. By building a SaaS service around Git, an open source project, Github was able to deliver value to and monetize that open-source ecosystem.This is also what made Github such an attractive acquisition for Microsoft in early June 2018, despite Microsoft's troubled history in the open-source community.

        <h2>Facts And Stats:</h2>
        <p><ul>
        <li>GitHub is written in Ruby on Rails and Erlang programming language by its cofounders.</li><br>
        <li>The JGit implementation of Git is a pure Java software library, designed to be embedded in any Java application.&nbsp Go-git is an open-source implementation of Git written in pure Go. It is currently used for backing projects as a SQL interface for Git code repositories and providing encryption for Git.&nbspThe Dulwich implementation of Git is a pure Python software component for Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5</li><br>
        <li>GitHub has become the Library of Alexandria for code examples.But if GitHub were ever to meet the same fate as the Library of Alexandria, it could be reconstructed from all those local forks distributed on so many developers laptops all over the world. Regardless of how this investment works out, that’s a hell of a legacy for the GitHub team to leave behind.</li><br>
        <li> The most popular project on GitHub is Bootstrap with over 115,000 Star and 55,000 Fork. The second spot is acquired by TensorFlow followed by Gitignore. Furthermore, the most discussed repository in 2017 is Kubernetes.</li><br>
        <li>In 2016, Python replaced Java as the 2nd most popular language, with 40% more pull request than the previous year. Also, Typescript is evolving at an enormous rate – its pull request has been increased almost 4 times in 2017.</li><br>
        <li>Linus Torvalds has hosted the Linux kernel source tree (with all documentations and subdirectories) on GitHub, and he works on it frequently.</li><br>
        <li>The mascot of GitHub is a female cat with 5 octopus-like arms. It was created by freelance graphic designer Simon Oxley (who also designed Twitter’s bird) to sell on iStock. GitHub became interested in his work named Octopuss. They bought exclusive rights and renamed it to Octocat. Since then, several users have designed hundreds of variations of the character.</li><br>
